/**
 * A simple class containing coordinates in the world.  Also contains
 * offsets between coordinates.  The way this works is say you have
 * some block at (x,y).  You then have a player who is almost at the
 * middle of that block, but a little to the right.  You would have a
 * slightly positive xOffset.  1 xOffset is the equivalent of 1 pixel.
